#' @title Repeat something with the ability to also collapse the output.
#' @description Repeat something with the ability to also collapse the output.
#'   The base `rep("ha", 3)` function does not support arguments like
#'   `collapse` or `sep` like `paste(...)`. `rep2` closes this gap.
#'
#' @param x The object to repeat
#' @param n The amount how often the object should be repeated
#' @param ... Further arguments passed to `paste` (see `help("paste")` for
#'   more information).
#'
#' @return The result from
#'   `paste(rep(x, n), sep = sep, collapse = collapse)`
#' @examples
#'   ## rep2 is the same like rep:
#'   rep(x = "ha", 3)
#'   #> "ha" "ha" "ha"
#'   rep2(x = "ha", 3)
#'   #> "ha" "ha" "ha"
#'
#'   ## ... but you can also use the arguments from `paste`:
#'   rep2(x = "ha", n = 3, collapse = "")
#'   #> "hahaha"
#'
#' @export
#'
rep2 <- function(x, n, ...) {
  return(paste(rep(x, n), ...))
}
