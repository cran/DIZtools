#' @title Get the difference of two vectors in both directions.
#'
#' @description The base-R function `setdiff` is asymmetric meaning
#'   `setdiff(vec1, vec2)` is not the same as `setdiff(vec2, vec1)`.
#'   Only the first vector will be compared to the second vector and all
#'   elements not contained in the second are in the resulting vector.
#'   So if you also want in include all elements being in the second vector
#'   but not in the first, you can use this function. In this case you are
#'   searching for elements being in the union of both vectors but not
#'   in the intersect of both vectors. This function is a symmetric function.
#'   It doesn't matter in which order you input the vectors, the content
#'   will be the same. Only the order of the elements inside the output
#'   differs.
#'
#' @param vec1 First vector
#' @param vec2 Second vector
#' @return The difference between both vectors.

#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' vec1 <- c(1,2,3,4)
#' vec2 <- c(3,4,5,6)
#' # setdiff(vec1, vec2) = c(1,2)
#' # setdiff(vec2, vec1) = c(5,6)
#' # setdiff_all(vec1, vec2) = c(1,2,5,6)
#' # setdiff_all(vec2, vec1) = c(5,6,1,2)
#' }
