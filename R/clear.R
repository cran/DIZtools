    ## Cleanup the backend in RStudio:
    ## Clears the console (imitates CTR + L)
    cat("\014")

    # Clears the Global Environment/variables/data:
    rm(list = ls(all.names = TRUE, envir = sys.frame(-1)),
       envir = sys.frame(-1))
  }
  ## Garbage collector/Clear unused RAM:
  invisible(gc())
  ## Turn it off (important or it gets very slow):
  gctorture(FALSE)
}
