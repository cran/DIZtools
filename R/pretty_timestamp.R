#'
#' @description Function to quickly get a pretty timestamp without
#'   need to handle format-options etc.
#' @param timestamp A POSIXct timestamp or a string which ca be converted to
#'   a POSIXct timestamp.
#' @param no_spaces Boolean. Default = `FALSE`. Specifies whether the output
#'   can contain spaces or not. E.g. if the output is for human reading,
#'   `no_spaces = FALSE` is a good option. As suffix for file names
#'   (e.g. logfiles), `no_spaces = TRUE` might be a good option.
#' @return The timestamp in always the same format.
#'#'
#' @examples
#' pretty_timestamp("2023-10-30 12:34:56", no_spaces = TRUE)
#' # Result: "2023-10-30T123456"
#' pretty_timestamp("2023-10-30 12:34:56")
#' # this is the same like
#' pretty_timestamp("2023-10-30 12:34:56", no_spaces = FALSE)
#' # Result: "30. Oct 2023 - 12:34 UTC"
