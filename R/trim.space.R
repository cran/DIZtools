#' @title Trim Spaces
#'
#' @description Removes leading and/or trailing space(s) from a character
#'   vector. By default, it removes both leading and trailing spaces.
#' @param x a character vector which values need whitespace trimming
#' @param what which part of the string should be trimmed.
#'   Defaults to \code{both} which removes trailing and leading spaces.
#'   If \code{none}, no trimming will be performed.
#' @param space.regex a character value containing a regex that defines a
#'   space character
#' @param ... additional arguments for \code{\link{gsub}} function
#' @return a character vector with (hopefully) trimmed spaces
#' @source \href{https://github.com/Rapporter/rapportools/blob/master/R/utils.R}{Copied from `rapportools::is.empty()`}
